# MIND
Mental health Identification using No-label Distillation

## Overview
MIND is a machine learning model in which a combination of META's DINO model is paired with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model seeks to classify mental states that are more time variant in nature. For instance, someone in an anxious state may have a rapid ascension said state. Previous instances (images/video) classifications of a person were based on facial expression alone. This is doubly problematic for detecting long-term mental health issues:  
1. Previous works only seek to classify based on a set of 7-9 basic emotions
    - $\textcolor{red}{Angry}$
    - $\textcolor{orange}{Surprise}$
    - $\textcolor{yellow}{Happy}$
    - $\textcolor{lime}{Fear}$
    - $\textcolor{blue}{Sad}$
    - $\textcolor{orchid}{Disgust}$
    - $\textcolor{purple}{Contempt}$
    - $\textcolor{gray}{Neutral}$
