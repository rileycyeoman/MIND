# MIND
Mental health Identification using No-label Distillation

## Overview
MIND is a machine learning model in which a combination of META's DINO model is paired with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model seeks to classify mental states that are more time variant in nature. For instance, someone in an anxious state may have a rapid ascension said state. Previous instances (images/video) of this person may classify as *happy* or *sad* based on facial expression alone.
